How to use Banana Launcher?

Banana Launcher is simple to use, and only require a few steps.

1 • As you saw on installation, you will have to download Banana Launcher and do the steps in Installation.

2 • Run the main.py file.

3 • It'll ask something like this:
``Choose a language.
1 - Português
2 - English`` Choose the language.

4 • It should show something like this:
``Language English chosen.
Servidor Iniciado: http://(yourip):8080(can be changed)``

5 • If you dont have, the code will create a folder called: public. It will show where it is in the code.

6 • In that folder, create a file called: index.html

7 • Put anything you want in that file.

8 • Enter your web browser, enter the http shown in the code, and it should be running a server in your browser.

9 • (optional?) To add more archives on the site, you can do this:

(REMINDER: Banana Launcher only supports html, txt, json, png, and jpg. Any other type of files wont work.)
``Add other files in the "public" folder. Name them whatever you want. Then, you can go back to your browser, and, ex:
http://(yourip):8080/(nameofyourfile).txt``

10 • (optional) You can custom almost everything in the code, since its pretty easy to understand. You can custom which folder it will be, and others.
